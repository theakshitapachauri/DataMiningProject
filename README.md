# DataMiningProject

Author : Akshita Pachauri

Data_Preprocessing1.ipynb : It is the .ipynb file which includes the implementation of the data preprocessing, including :

- Conversion of the original dataset to a format that fits our NN’s input form. 

- Transforming original dataset’s records into into a set of binary variables

- Spliting the converted dataset into 3 files: training.txt for network training, val.txt for validation, and testing.txt for network testing. 

The implementation of 3 files: formulas.py, models.py, and proj_test.py, have been completed.

Since the provided code had the python support of python2, I have written code which would be compatible for python2.

To run the project : python proj_test.py
